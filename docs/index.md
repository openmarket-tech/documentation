# OpenMarket Documentation

OpenMarket is an NFT marketplace. OpenMarket is built on three main modules:
-	Frontend: User can browse, filter, buy, and sell NFTs.
-	Backend: Indexing NFTs and the corresponding metadata. Keep track of the order book. Provides APIs for the frontend.
-	Smart-Contract / DEX: Buy trades relay only on blockchain technology. By buying NFTs the user directly interacts over a P2P network with the smart contract without a centralized party.

OpenMarket comes with two different flavors. The public instance and a white label instance. The white able instance is designed to run on the customers infrastructure or cloud service where the customer is in full control of all the components. This document focuses on the white label flavor.
